My NixOS configuration!

NixOS, nix and all of the things that NixOS Fundation have to offer, are amazing and well built, but for a specific purpose. I am a REAL tinkerer and system breaking fella myself so it's hard for me to do it if I have to keep everything declarative, also a lot of ancient and not popular software is available.

After using it daily sine **Aug 3, 2024**, I can say that I know more or less how it functions internally, Vimjoyer's videos were very helpful in that topic, thank you for that :). I was even able to deploy software for [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) called [hellwal](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/he/hellwal/package.nix).

It was wonderful ride and good learning experience, but it comes to an end. I'll leave this repo, maybe some people will find this useful. This is **THE** last commit here. Thank you NixOS.

> I'll still use NixOS for servers it seems to be OP in this field.
